# Parametric Models for Single-Spell Duration Data 

This chapter makes use of two different datasets: data on the duration of UN peacekeeping operations from 1948-2001 (originally used in Green et al. 1998) and data on the duration of European cabinet governments from King et al. 1990. Each of the figures and tables are replicated in both R and Stata. Let's start with the UN data in R and Stata first, and then move on to the cabinet data in R and Stata. 

## UN Data in R 

```{r, child = 'chapter3/ch3_un.rmd'}

```

## UN Data in Stata 

```{r, child = 'chapter3/ch3_un_stata.rmd'}

```

## Cabinet Data in R

```{r, child = 'chapter3/ch3_cabinet.rmd'}

```

## Cabinet Data in Stata

```{r, child = 'chapter3/ch3_cabinet_stata.rmd'}

```




# The Cox Proportional Hazards Model 

This chapter makes use of the cabinet data used in the previous chapter. 

## Cabinet Data in R

```{r, child = 'chapter4/ch4_cabinet.rmd'}

```

## Cabinet Data in Stata

```{r, child = 'chapter4/ch4_cabinet_stata.rmd'}

```

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
